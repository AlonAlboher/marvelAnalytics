----------------------------------------------------------

Within this repository you will find a PPTX file (MarvelDataAnalytics29102024.pptx) 
and a similar PDF file (MarvelDataAnalytics23092024Fixed.pdf) containing the presentation of our entire process as well as KPIs,
<br>
data research, analytics, dashboards and more.

Our intial research and analysis covered the Marvel studios productions, targeted audience, income, budgets, reviews etc.
<br>
We based our research on data recovered from the Kaggle, Rotten tomatoes, Wikipedia and other web sources.

Our intial KPIs were:
---------------------
1. Do Marvel studios work in accordance with a production plan? If so, what is the plan?
2. How many productions did Marvel studios make and are they connected?
3. How much does Marvel studios spend on their productions?
4. Who is watching productions made by Marvel studios?
5. How much did Marvel studios earn from their productions?
6. Do Marvel studios invest most of its resources in the right social network?
7. At what times are posts usually posted?
8. What is the average engagement rate of Marvel studios social media?
9. What are the best times for Marvel studios to post with regards to their crowd?
10. What are Marvel Studios followers looking for in posts?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The PBIX file (marvel_visuals.pbix) was the first dashboard created with the data we gathered to answer our KPIs,
The dashboard is assimilated from the following files:
mcu_box_office.csv, viewers.xlsx, instagram.xlsx, tiktok.xlsx, x.xlsx

The second part of our project revolved around Marvel studios social media data.

Our social media KPIs:
-----------------------
1. Do Marvel studios invest most of its resources in the right social network?

2. At what times do Marvel studios usually post?

3. What is the average engagement rate of Marvel studios social media?

4. What are the best times for Marvel studios to post with regards to their crowd?

5. What are Marvel studios followers looking for in posts?

Using the previous dashboard and the XLSX files for the social media companies we answered the first KPI,
We have learned that most of Marvel studious social media investment is made on Instagram & X while in reality most
of their viewer pool is probably using TikTok based on their avarage age, and so we recommanded shifting more resources to TikTok.

**Our reasearch and analytics thus far have all been based on factual data taken from various web sources,**
<br>
**The following part of the project is based on hypothatical data used for ability demonstration only**

The following files were provided to us by our teachers to create a social database:
<br>
comments.csv, follows.csv, likes.csv, photo_tags.csv, photos.csv, tags.csv, users.csv

We created this database using MSSQL, and using this database we wrote the code within SocialFinalProject29102024UnitedFinalFile.sql
<br>
This SQL code answers all the other KPIs presented before.
